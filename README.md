# Image Quilting Texture & Synthesis
Patch-based algorithm to synthesize a texture of any desired size from the given sample
Modified the quilting algorithm to transfer given texture to target image & improved the output by 31%
Obtained computationally efficient and stable output with stochastic & semi-structured textures

Note : Images tested have not been added to this Github due to Copyright issues
